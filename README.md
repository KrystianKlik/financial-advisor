# Financial Advisor

## Overview

Welcome to the Financial Advisor project! This project aims to provide users with financial advice and management services through integration with the Revolut API. The architecture of this system is based on microservices, with separate services for managing users, interfacing with the Revolut API, and handling core functionalities of the advisor. The ultimate goal is to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance the user experience and provide personalized financial recommendations.

## Features

- **User Management**: This microservice handles user authentication, registration, and profile management.
  
- **Revolut Integration**: The Revolut microservice interacts with the Revolut API to access user financial data, such as transactions, balances, and account information.

- **Core Advisor Functionality**: This microservice contains the core logic of the financial advisor, including algorithms for financial analysis, recommendation generation, and portfolio management.

- **AI Enhancement (Planned)**: In the future, AI capabilities will be integrated to enhance the advisor's functionality, providing personalized recommendations based on user behavior, financial goals, and market analysis.
